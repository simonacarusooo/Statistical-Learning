# Statistical-Learning
The university project of Statistical Learning aims to conduct analyses on a chosen dataset using both supervised and unsupervised methods. My project focuses on a dataset developed for water safety classification purposes. I applied logistic regression, LASSO, classification trees, and Random Forests to comprehend the most significant variables in predicting water safety. Moreover, using the same dataset with the response variable excluded, I performed clustering analyses to uncover potential hidden patterns in the data.
